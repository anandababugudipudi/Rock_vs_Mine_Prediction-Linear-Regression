# **Rock vs Mine Prediction**
### **Problem Statement**
The problem is to predict metal or rock objects from sonar return data. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The label associated with each record contains the letter R if the object is a rock and M if it is a mine (metal cylinder).

### **Work Flow of the Project**
- Collecting the Data
- Data Preprocessing
- Splitting the Data into Train and Test Data
- Developing a Logistic Regression Model
- Evaluating the Model
- Making a predictive System
